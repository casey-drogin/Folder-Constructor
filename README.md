Folder Constructor is an easily editable folder-tree creator. Simply double-click the .html file to open in your browser.

Once open, simply write or copy - paste from a spreadsheet. 

These will automatically create a folder tree. 

You can reorder folder tiers. You can also create folders per item, or folders that are global inside every folderr.

When ready, download final folder as a .zip file to your computer.
